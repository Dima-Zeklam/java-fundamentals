### Lab 1: 
* I Created 3 functions they took about 1 and 30 min hours.
* First function named Pluralize took about 10 min.
* Secound function named flipNHeads which took 15 min.
* Third function named (clock) took 50 min. 
* The remainder time went on prepered the work and run app.

### lab2:
* basiclibrary2 at the main - basiclibrary2/lib/src/main/java/basiclibrary2/Library.java contains the methodes :

method | description
------- | ---------
Rolling Dice | return an array containing the values of the rolls.
containsDuplicates | return true if there is duplicate  and false if there no duplicate for the element insid the array.
averageTest | returns the average of all the values in the array.
lowestAverage | return the array with the lowest average.

* The test for each method inside basiclibrary2/lib/src/test/java/basiclibrary2/LibraryTest.java 

### lab3: 
* basiclibrary2 at the main - basiclibrary2/lib/src/main/java/basiclibrary2/Library.java contains the methodes :

method | description
------- | ---------
analyzingWeather | this method accepts two dimensional array and return the numbers that never saw temperature of type string, by using HashSet and List and make test for this method.
tally | this method accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes, i use Map also make test for this method

* The test for each method inside basiclibrary2/lib/src/test/java/basiclibrary2/LibraryTest.java 


### Lab 6 :inheritance
* I created class named Resturant with an attributes, and one constructor that contain three parameters.
* I created class named Review with an attributes, and one constructor that contain three parameters.
* Inside Resturant class I use *ArrayList* to hold the reviws for a single resturant and declare addReview method to add reviews in the ArrayList.
* I Implemented a reasonable toString method for Resturant and Review classes.
* I created starsAvg() method in Resturant class to get the avarege for Resturant number of stars from reviews number of stars.
#### testing
1. TestResturantClass method for Restaurant constructor to check is behaving reasonably also ensure that its toString method is working properly.
2. TestReviewClass method for Review constructor to check is behaving reasonably also ensure that its toString method is working properly.
3. AddReviewAndUpdateToStringTest method for testing the addReview method and the Updated toString .
